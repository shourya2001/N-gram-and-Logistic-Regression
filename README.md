# N-gram-and-Logistic-Regression

## Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook, `N_gram_and_Logistic_Regression.ipynb`, that demonstrates the application of N-gram techniques for text data processing and the implementation of logistic regression for classification tasks. The notebook provides a practical example of working with text data and predictive modeling in Python.

## Features
- **Text Data Processing**: Tokenization and feature extraction using N-grams.
- **Model Implementation**: Logistic Regression applied to text-based datasets.
- **Evaluation**: Model evaluation through metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and more.
- **Visualization**: Optional visualizations for understanding data and results.

## Prerequisites

To run this notebook, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.7+
- Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab
- Required libraries:
  - `numpy`
  - `pandas`
  - `scikit-learn`
  - `matplotlib` (optional, for visualizations)
  - `nltk` or other text processing libraries (if applicable)

You can install these packages using pip:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib nltk
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/shourya2001/N_gram_and_Logistic_Regression.git
cd N_gram_and_Logistic_Regression
```

2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook N_gram_and_Logistic_Regression.ipynb
```

3. Follow the steps in the notebook to:
   - Load and preprocess your dataset.
   - Extract features using N-grams.
   - Train and evaluate a logistic regression model.

4. Modify the code to work with your own datasets or adjust parameters as needed.

## Dataset

This notebook is designed to work with text-based datasets. If no dataset is provided, you can use any publicly available datasets or create your own. Make sure the dataset is formatted properly and loaded correctly into the notebook.

## Results
The notebook demonstrates how N-gram features can improve text classification and evaluates the performance of logistic regression for the given problem.
